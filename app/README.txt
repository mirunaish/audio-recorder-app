created in 2019 or so, v1 only had recording functionality
added list tab in october 2021
looked at a few tutorials and a lot of documentation and stackoverflow questions while making this
got a bit of help during the dali application help sessions too

i included the apk in the repository in case the code won't run for whatever reason
only tested on Android API 30

there's a setting in the emulator for "uses host audio input" which lets you record audio from pc
